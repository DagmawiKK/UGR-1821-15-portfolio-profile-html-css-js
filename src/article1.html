            <h1>Understanding C: The Foundation of Modern Programming</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that has had a profound impact on computer science and programming as a whole. First developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs, C has become a cornerstone for many modern programming languages and is widely used for system and application development. This article explores the features, history, and significance of C, as well as its application in contemporary programming.</p>
