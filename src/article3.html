            <section>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Philosophy, often regarded as the "love of wisdom," is a profound intellectual discipline that has shaped human thought for centuries. It encompasses a wide range of topics, from existence and knowledge to ethics and the nature of reality. By questioning fundamental aspects of life, philosophy encourages critical thinking and a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.</p>

                <h2>What is Philosophy?</h2>
                <p>At its essence, philosophy seeks to explore the underlying principles and concepts that govern existence. It engages with fundamental questions such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is the nature of reality?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What can we know, and how do we know it?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the basis for moral values and ethical behavior?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What is the meaning of life?</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Philosophy can be broadly categorized into several branches:</p>
